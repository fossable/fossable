This crate contains official imagery and digital provenance for all Fossable projects.

## Cryptomarks

Since Fossable isn't a legal organization, it owns no trademarks. Instead, everything
"owned" by Fossable is cryptographically signed to prove authenticity. This includes
all software artifacts, graphics, domains, etc.

The `fossable` CLI is used to verify artifacts.
